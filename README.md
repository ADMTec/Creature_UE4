## Prepackaged Plugin Code for Compilation

If you want to compile the plugins for a C++ project, I have included a Prepackaged archive that you can use
to save you the steps in copying the files over and setting up the appropriate directory structures.

Look in the folder **PrePackagePluginSetup** for that archive.
