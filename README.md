# Creature-Runtimes

This is the runtime for Creature, the advanced 2D Skeletal and Mesh Animation Tool. This runtime is for the Unreal Engine aka UE4 pipeline. It allows you to load in, play back and control your authored Creature Characters in the UE4 environment. Character playback and control are done through Creature's Blueprints enabled functionality.

## Prepackaged Plugin Code for Compilation

If you want to compile the plugins for a C++ project, I have included a Prepackaged archive that you can use
to save you the steps in copying the files over and setting up the appropriate directory structures.

Look in the folder **PrePackagePluginSetup** for that archive.
